# Exercise 3: Web Ontologies and Knowledge Graphs
This repository contains:
- A partial implementation of a Web ontology for the domain of Agriculture based on the [SAMOD methodology](https://essepuntato.it/samod/). 
- A partial implementation of a [JaCaMo](https://github.com/jacamo-lang/jacamo) application, in which autonomous agents are able to query a knowledge graph
to retrieve knowledge about the world — and to use that knowledge to manage a farm.

## Task 2 
### Task 2.1
- Extend the [Glossary of terms](SAMOD/agriculture-domain/README.md) to define new terms that are required for describing the Motivating scenario and for defining its Competency questions
- Update the [TBox](SAMOD/agriculture-domain/tbox.ttl) to formally define your new terms in an ontology. You can import the TBox in [Protege](https://protege.stanford.edu/) to work on top of the base ontology

### Task 2.2
- Update the [ABox](SAMOD/agriculture-domain/abox.ttl) to complete the formal description of the motivating scenario
  - TIPS: 
    - Use the new terms that you defined in your TBox
    - Currently, the ABox implements the description of the motivating scenario that is required for solving the first 3 competency questions
- Setup your [GraphDB](https://sandbox-graphdb.interactions.ics.unisg.ch/) repository for testing your ABox and TBox:
  - Import your TBox file in your repository: `Import` > `RDF` > `Upload RDF files`
  - Insert your ABox statements in your repository by creating and executing SPARQL INSERT queries
    - TIP: The [queries/insert](SAMOD/agriculture-domain/queries/insert) directory contains example INSERT queries
  - Create and execute in your repository SPARQL SELECT queries that formalize the competency questions 
    - TIP: The [queries/select](SAMOD/agriculture-domain/queries/select) directory contains example SELECT queries that formalize the first 3 competency questions 

### Task 2.3
- Complete the methods of the Java class [`FarmKG`](src/env/farm/FarmKG.java) that enable autonomous agents to query your GraphDB repository through a JaCaMo application:
- `queryFarmSections()`
- `querySectionCoordinates()`
- `queryCropOfSection()`
- `queryRequiredMoisture()`
- TIPS:
  - Use your SPARQL SELECT queries from Task 2.2 that formalize the competency questions q4, q5, q6, and q7.
  - The class [`FarmKG`](src/env/farm/FarmKG.java) contains the full implementation of the example methods `queryFarm()` and `queryThing()`

## How to run the project
### 1. Run the mockserver that mocks the tractors' HTTP APIs

Run [MockServer](https://www.mock-server.com/) with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/):
   ```
   docker run -v "$(pwd)"/mockserver/tractors.json:/tmp/mockserver/tractors.json -e MOCKSERVER_INITIALIZATION_JSON_PATH=/tmp/mockserver/tractors.json -d --rm --name      mockserver -p 1080:1080 mockserver/mockserver
   ```
 The above command will run a Docker container in the background and will print the container ID. To stop a container run: `docker stop <CONTAINER_ID>`.
You can use this [Postman collection](https://api.postman.com/collections/2431802-7df760e4-7bd6-430a-a15f-f189b66ad619?access_key=PMAT-01GTWY6C8F4EZ44DV7T7Y7XWAF) to inspect the behavior of the tractors' mockserver.


### 2. Run the JaCaMo application

You can run the project directly in Visual Studio Code or from the command line with Gradle 7.4.
- In VSCode:  Click on the Gradle Side Bar elephant icon, and navigate through `GRADLE PROJECTS` > `exercise-3` > `Tasks` > `jacamo` > `task`.
- On MacOS and Linux run the following command:
```shell
./gradlew task
```
- On Windows run the following command:
```shell
gradle.bat task
```
